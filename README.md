# EqualsEquals Website 2018
This is the EqualsEquals hackathon website development kit. Yes, I used PHP. Don't @ me.

## Development
Just activate a PHP server and request `www/index.php` to build the site automatically in your browser.

## Push into production
I've created  script to automatically push the site onto the live gh-pages branch. Just run `./production`
